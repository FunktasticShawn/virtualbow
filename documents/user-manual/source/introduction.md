# Introduction

Welcome to the user manual for VirtualBow!

This manual will help you understand how to use this software for designing bows, running simulations and interpreting the results.
For support, feedback or to get the latest version of the software and this manual please visit the project's website at [https://www.virtualbow.org/](https://www.virtualbow.org/).

Like many other simulation tools, VirtualBow consists of three distinct components: A model editor, a solver and a result viewer.

- The model editor is the most important part of the application from a user's perspective.
Here you can create, edit and save your designs, which will be stored as `.bow` files.

- In the background, the actual work of running a simulation is done by the solver.
It takes the `.bow` file, performs the required calculations and saves the results as a `.res` result file.

- Finally, the result viewer is used to open and visualize the `.res` file produced by the solver.
Here you can view the simulation results and evaluate your designs.

The layout of this manual follows this separation.
The coming chapters will therefore explain each of these components in more detail, starting with the model editor.
