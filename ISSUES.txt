Model
=====

    * Crash when height goes to zero

    * Include model in testing. Keep suite of test files and test the output for regressions.

General
=======

    * Restructure. Put code in cpp files, include less stuff in headers to reduce compile times.

    * Decide between using std::array and Eigen::Array, then replace one with the other.

    * Can Eigen::Array<2, dynamic> replace the custom Series class?

    * Lambdas: Most lambdas could capture only [this], instead of [&]

    * Find a consistent style regarding this->

    * How to avoid using ../../ in includes?

    * Use the GUI editor to rid the setup and layout code, etc... ?

    * Use auto& more often instead of auto?

    * Use Linspace class more often (e.g. for sampling curvces)

    * Use DiscreteLimb class for graphic previews. Give it an optional sampling parameter to use instead of the number of elements.

    * Replace unsigned int with unsigned?

Platform dependent
==================

    * Look at OS-X Interface guidelines: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/MenuIconsSymbols.html

    * OS-X: Hide menu icons? (Application::setAttribute(Qt::AA_DontShowIconsInMenus, true))

   !* OS-X: How to set the displayed application name to sonething else than the filename?

Ideas for Improvement
=====================

    * Slider in output window could have a go-to menu with options like "maximum limb stress", "arrow separation", "maximum string force", ...

    * Command-line interface:
        * Start simulations, static or dynamic
        * Option to supress Progress? Option to show it in the first place?
        * Create default bow file
        * Option to specify output file
        * Invoke Program on input file: Simulation from command line
        * Invoke Program on output file: Show output window

    * Sampling frequency instead of sampling time?
