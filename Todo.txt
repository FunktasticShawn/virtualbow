GUI
===
    * Bug: Repeatedly clicking the load and save icons and closing the dialogs with x sometimes makes the program messages like,

          QXcbConnection: XCB error: 3 (BadWindow), sequence: 1352, resource id: 7826577, major code: 40 (TranslateCoords), minor code: 0

    * Bug/Annoyance: Application name is shown behind window title even in simple dialogs (about box, file dialogs, ...)

    * Decision: Use theme icons on linux or just use the same icons everywhere?

    * DoubleView:
        
        * Why doesn't it show large numbers in scientific notation?

        * Display large numbers in engineering format (e+03, e+06, e+09, ...) instead of scientific

    * SeriesView:
        
        * Enable/Implement copy and paste

        * Find solution for default values and validation

    * Find a solution to localised numbers.
        a) Use the C locale, convert local decimal separator to dot manually
        b) Use the default locale and somehow get rid of the thousands separator

    * Maybe the settings be in the simulation menu and toolbar.

    * Plot:

        * Enable user interactions. Prerequisite: no call to rescaleAxes when fixing the aspect ratio.

        * Add a contect menu action to reset the plot if user interaions are enabled.

        * Handle errors when exporting.

        * Can (and should?) the file menus for plot export and the main one "remember" different locations?

FEM
===

    * Find a way to prevent changing element properties during simulation. Could be done by having the system own
      the elements and only pass a const& of the system in the simulation callbacks.

    * Make simulation callbacks in System templates

Model
=====

    * InputData: Extend domain such that values in a certain interval can be expressed, e.g. the step factor in ]0, 1]

    * DocItem: value is default constructed and might not be valid until the DocItem is assigned a valid one. Perhaps express this with boost::optional.

General
=======

    * Restructure. Put code in cpp files, include less stuff in headers to reduce compile times.

    * Decide between using std::array and Eigen::Array, then replace one with the other.

    * tests fail on Windows 7 with MinGW 5.3.0 32bit.

    * Lambdas: Most lambdas could capture only [this], instead of [&]
