    * Bug: When suggesting save before creating new file the discard button shouldn't say "Close without saving"
      but rather something like "Discard changes". (Platform dependent?)

    * Bug/Annoyance: About box breaks the line about licensing before "v3.0" (Platform dependent)

    * Toolbar icons under Windows

    * Application icon

    * Bug: Repeatedly clicking the load and save icons and closing the dialogs with x sometimes makes the program print the following message,

          QXcbConnection: XCB error: 3 (BadWindow), sequence: 1352, resource id: 7826577, major code: 40 (TranslateCoords), minor code: 0

FEM

    * Find a way to prevent changing element properties during simulation. Could be done by having the system own
      the elements and only pass a const& of the system in the simulation callbacks.

    * Make simulation callbacks in System templates

General
=======

    * Restructure. Put code in cpp files, include less stuff in headers to reduce compile times.

    * Decide between using std::array and Eigen::Array, then replace one with the other.
