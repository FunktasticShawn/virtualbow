GUI
===
    * Bug: Repeatedly clicking the load and save icons and closing the dialogs with x sometimes makes the program messages like,

          QXcbConnection: XCB error: 3 (BadWindow), sequence: 1352, resource id: 7826577, major code: 40 (TranslateCoords), minor code: 0

    * Bug/Annoyance: Application name is shown behind window title even in simple dialogs (about box, file dialogs, ...)

    * Decision: Use theme icons on linux or just use the same icons everywhere?

    * DoubleView:
        
        * Why doesn't it show large numbers in scientific notation?

        * Display large numbers in engineering format (e+03, e+06, e+09, ...) instead of scientific

    * SeriesView:
        
        * Implement copy, cut and paste

        * After a selection is deleted: Automatically select a new row (above? below?)

        * Find solution for default values and validation

    * Find a solution to localised numbers.
        a) Use the C locale, convert local decimal separator to dot manually
        b) Use the default locale and somehow get rid of the thousands separator

    * Maybe the settings should be in the simulation menu and toolbar.

    * Plot:

        * Enable user interactions. Prerequisite: no call to rescaleAxes when fixing the aspect ratio.

        * Add a contect menu action to reset the plot if user interaions are enabled.

        * Handle errors when exporting.

        * Can (and should) the file menus for plot export and the main one "remember" different locations?

        * Allow selecting curves with left click which then also opens the context menu

        * Make the labels the same font(size) as the SeriesView headers

    * SettingsDialog:

        * Width of the integer and double views should be the same. Last resort: Set default width of the  integer views.

    * Width and height plots: Show the actual arc length if a valid profile curve is defined. (Second x-Axis?)

    * ProgressView: Handle exceptions from the simulation thread

    * File path as program argument

    * Replace the separate static and dynamic launch buttons with a QToolButton with arrow icon and a drop down menu for selection?

    * Set the executable icon

FEM
===

    * Find a way to prevent changing element properties during simulation. Could be done by having the system own
      the elements and only pass a const& of the system in the simulation callbacks.

    * Make simulation callbacks in System templates

Model
=====

    * InputData: Extend domain such that values in a certain interval can be expressed, e.g. the step factor in ]0, 1]

    * DocItem: value is default constructed and might not be valid until the DocItem is assigned a valid one. Perhaps express this with boost::optional.

General
=======

    * Restructure. Put code in cpp files, include less stuff in headers to reduce compile times.

    * Decide between using std::array and Eigen::Array, then replace one with the other.

    * Can Eigen::Array<2, dynamic> replace the custom Series class?

    * tests fail on Windows 7 with MinGW 5.3.0 32bit.

    * Lambdas: Most lambdas could capture only [this], instead of [&]

    * Find a consistent style regarding this->

Platform dependent
==================

    * Read OS-X Interface guidelines: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/MenuIconsSymbols.html

    * OS-X: Hide menu icons? (Application::setAttribute(Qt::AA_DontShowIconsInMenus, true))

    * OS-X: How to set the displayed application name to sonething else than the filename?
