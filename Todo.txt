GUI

    * Find a way to handle comma vs dot as decimal separator, otherwise note in docs

    * Bug: Edit NumberView, don't leave and close main window. Saving will not be suggested.

    * Bug: When suggesting save before creating new file the discard button shouldn't say "Close without saving"
      but rather something like "Discard changes". (Platform dependent?)

FEM
===

    * Find a way to prevent changing element properties during simulation. Could be done by having the system own
      the elements and only pass a const& of the system in the simulation callbacks.

    * Make simulation callbacks in System templates

General
=======

    * Restructure. Put code in cpp files, include less stuff in headers to reduce compile times.

    * Decide between using std::array and Eigen::Array, then replace one with the other.
